This code attempts to access an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  This can lead to unexpected crashes or undefined behavior.  The problem is particularly insidious because the out-of-bounds index might only occur under specific conditions or with particular inputs, making it hard to debug. 

```objectivec
- (void)someMethod:(NSArray *)myArray {
    NSInteger index = [self calculateIndex:someValue]; // This function might sometimes return a value outside the array bounds
    if (index >=0 && index < myArray.count) {
        NSString *item = myArray[index];
        // Do something with item
    } else {
        NSLog("Index out of bounds: %ld", (long)index);
    }
}
```
