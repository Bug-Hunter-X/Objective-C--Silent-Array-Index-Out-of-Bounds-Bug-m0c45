This repository demonstrates a subtle and difficult-to-debug bug in Objective-C: an array index that goes out of bounds. The `bug.m` file contains the erroneous code, which uses a potentially faulty index calculation. The `bugSolution.m` file offers a corrected version with improved error handling and bounds checking. This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and thorough input validation when working with arrays in Objective-C.
